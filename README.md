# Hello-World
I learnt github using this, but as time goes on, something better will come in.

I am David Otoosakyi, a Data Scientist in embryo... I developed interest in the field of Data Science in the late 2019 so I decided to make a switch to it as part of my Vision for 2020.

Currently I am an IT Student learning Python for Data Science @ Datalab Technology, FCT Abuja, Nigeria.

I am confident and hope in God that at the end of this Industrial Training (with serious hardwork), I should be proficient in Data Science with the ability to work on different projects, especially Predictive Models.

My goal is to be the Top-Ranked Data Scientist on Zindi.africa and Kaggle.com

Further information about my progress in this field will be updated here.

Thanks for taking your time to read this.
